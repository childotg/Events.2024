**Session Title:**
"Optimizing Kubernetes Automation with Azure DevOps and Hierarchical YAML: A Practical Approach"

**Session Abstract:**
In the rapidly evolving landscape of software delivery, Kubernetes (K8s) stands as a critical tool for orchestrating containers. While GitOps tools are commonly employed to achieve high levels of automation in K8s environments, they can sometimes pose limitations. This session introduces an innovative alternative using Azure DevOps combined with hierarchical YAML. Unlike traditional GitOps tools, this approach simplifies the management process without sacrificing functionality. Attendees will explore the nuances of enhancing K8s automation, learn from real-world applications, and discover best practices to boost deployment efficiency in their projects.

**Outline:**
1. **Introduction**
   - Brief overview of Kubernetes and its importance in modern DevOps.
   - Challenges commonly faced with traditional GitOps tools.

2. **Target Audience**
   - Introduction to the session's target audience: emerging DevOps professionals and developers transitioning into DevOps roles.
   - Discussion on the complexity of the DevOps field and the steep learning curve for beginners.

3. **Building Blocks of a Fully Engineered DevOps Project**
   - Explanation of typical components: Git repository, continuous build tools, Docker image workflows, Kubernetes release pipelines, and artifact repositories.
   - Introduction of the concept of starting with a monolithic approach rather than individual building blocks.

4. **Introducing the Proposed Approach: Azure DevOps with Hierarchical YAML**
   - Detailed explanation of how Azure DevOps functions similarly to other CI/CD tools but without distinct advantages.
   - Introduction to hierarchical YAML and how it helps in defining a base model for each microservice, enabling generic pipelines that do not require individual artifacts for each project.
   - Benefits of this approach in simplifying governance and configuration management.

5. **Real-World Application and Case Study**
   - Detailed case study from Witailer: managing over 50 microservices before establishing a dedicated DevOps area.
   - Examples of rapid deployment capabilities, base Docker image updates across multiple services, and support for ARM architecture.

6. **Skills and Knowledge Required**
   - Discussion on the necessary developer skills and basic Kubernetes and scripting knowledge required for this approach.
   - Suggestions for preparing and training teams to implement these practices.

7. **Q&A and Common Challenges**
   - Addressing potential obstacles such as the need for development teams to adhere to specific Git repository rules and the propagation of deployment features across services.
   - Answering questions on security, configuration management comparison with traditional GitOps tools, and scalability in larger Kubernetes environments.

8. **Conclusion and Future Directions**
   - Summary of key takeaways from the session.
   - Discussion on the gradual transition from a monolithic model to a more modular approach as teams develop the requisite skills and experience.
   - Encouragement for attendees to consider this approach as an enabler rather than a replacement for more robust enterprise solutions.

This structured session will provide a comprehensive view of optimizing Kubernetes automation using a unique approach with Azure DevOps and hierarchical YAML, aimed at helping DevOps professionals and developers streamline their deployment processes and improve their operational efficiency.
